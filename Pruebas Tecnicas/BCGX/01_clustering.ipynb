    "## Context\n",
    "The AIRBCG carrier group is defining a new marketing campaign for passengers called \"Embrace your flight, enjoy your life\". The campaing consist of points delivering to passengers to redeem promotions and discounts on the next purchase **considering the characteristics of the flights and destinations**. It is a loyalty and profitability campaign for the group that seeks to identify **carrier segments** and **flights** in order to define the loyalty strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The group hopes to identify a minimum of 4 segments and a maximum of 8 to make an investment of 500k USD in the campaign, achieving a return of 30% for the next 2 years. The campaign will be display only in the US west coast (Arizona, California, Idaho, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description of the data:\n",
    "We have provided you with 12 months of AIRBCG carrier group data along with lookup tables for carriers and airports. Please Use the following questions as guidelines for your analysis. You are expected to solved and also create a cohesive business case from them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected outputs: \n",
    "1. Descriptive answer for **each** question. There should be an answer for every required question.\n",
    "2. The code used\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explicitly state whether you used an LLM tool (e.g., ChatGPT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints:\n",
    "- Limit your data wrangling time. The data is already been processed to be a good starting point for this challenge\n",
    "- To answer the questions feel free to use the libraries' online documentation and/or StackOverflow\n",
    "- Make as many assumptions you consider necessary and make sure you document them in the notebook"
